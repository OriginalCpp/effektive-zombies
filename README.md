This is a top-down survival game written in Effekt.

## Gameplay Mechanics

`Wave`: Shown in the top left corner of the in-game screen. The higher the wave, the more frequent zombies spawn.

`Combo`: Shown in the bottom right of the in-game screen. The higher your combo, the more points you get for each zombie killed. Your combo increases for every zombie you kill. It gets reset if you either get hit by a zombie or you miss a bullet (bullet leaves the screen and thus cannot hit zombies anymore).
